
 Model Architecture
Our model architecture includes an additional feature from the contrastive learning with the high-level features from the end-to-end model.

 Contrastive learning 
This learning method learns to extract the contrast between an input and represent them as a contrastive feature map which are learnt through the similarity classification.

### End-to-end classification
The end-to-end model takes a pair of sky images and make a prediction whether a moving object is exists.

 Implementation
We provide two approaches of implmentations. First, we provides test.py and test.ipynb to show how our model make a prediction on 64*64 patches. Moreover, for full_img_test.py, we demonstrate how to use our model for .fits images. The latter approach includes both patch extractor and classifier heads to complete the whole process.
